# Mosme
A supposed client for the https://github.com/usememos/memos app written in C++ with Qt.

This is part of a project for the CS4076 module (University Of Limerick).

The code is scuffed because I started 2 weeks before the deadline lol.
Please do not take into account the code quality, I can do better, I promise,
look at my contributions over the [ppy/osu](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AItsShamed+is%3Amerged) repo. Well not *all* contributions but you get it.

> **Note**
> Fun fact the way how the API client works is completely ripped-off osu! and just adapted to Qt lol.

# Contributions

Honestly, this project doesn't even deserve any contributions given how shitty the code is.
